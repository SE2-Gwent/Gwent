# Gwent game
# by Fischbacher, Kuttnig, Longinus, Seher, WÃ¶lbitsch

The project is split up into the app module and the gamelogic module.
The app module consists of the GUI part of our game. The gamelogic is there for the 
Firebase communication and all the gamelogic stuff you need locally.


# Local Development

> the firebase certificates according to [Project Setup](https://github.com/SE2-Gwent/Gwent/wiki)
> 
> When running our game locally the code is automatically reformatted with spotless.

# Build

# Testing
> Run the unit testsuite via ```gradle check```
>
